  // Need extra parenthesis around the || clause

3.In Java, the standard streams are referred to by System.in (for stdin), System. out (for stdout), 
and System. err (for stderr).

4. System.out implements the standard output stream. The standard output stream is a C library concept that has been 
assimilated into the Java language. Simply put, a stream is a flowing buffer of characters; the standard output stream is
 a stream that writes its contents to the display.
 The standard output stream is a convenient place for any (old-fashioned text-based 
application to display its output.

5. The standard input stream is an InputStream . 
InputStream which is an abstract base class from which all input streams(Java InputStream Class --
-FileInputStream.
-ByteArrayInputStream.
-ObjectInputStream.)
 in the java.io package derive. 
The InputStream class defines a methods for reading bytes or arrays of bytes,
 marking locations in the stream, skipping bytes of input, 
finding out the number of bytes that are available for reading, 
and resetting the current position within the stream. 
An input stream is automatically opened when you create it. You can explicitly close a stream with the 
close() method, or let it be closed implicitly when the object is garbage collected.

6. The java.io package contains two classes, InputStream and OutputStream, 
from which most of the other classes in the package derive.

7. The OutputStream class is an abstract base class.
 OutputStream defines methods for writing bytes or arrays of bytes to the stream and flushing the stream. 
An output stream is automatically opened when you create it. You can explicitly close an output stream 
with the close() method, or let it be closed implicitly when the object is garbage collected.
